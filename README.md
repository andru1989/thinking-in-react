# React Tutorial

This is the React example from [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html).

## To use

Start a server with:

```sh
ruby server.rb
```

And visit <http://localhost:3000/>. Try opening multiple tabs!

## Changing the port

You can change the port number by setting the `$PORT` environment variable before invoking any of the scripts above, e.g.,

```sh
PORT=3001 ruby server.rb
```
